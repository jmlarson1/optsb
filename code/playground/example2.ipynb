    "Instructions on running `test_track.py` which executes TRACK for the sps_line inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Overview\n",
    "- basic decsription of the example\n",
    "- list a few pre-req. installs\n",
    "- clone the github\n",
    "- run `test_track.py` show outputs\n",
    "- TODO: run `data_generator.py` which includes the openai gym-env components including TRACK sim\n",

    "# Basic Description and Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "This example will showcase the running of TRACK for the sps beam line. \n",
    "It includes the modification of the quadrupole parameters as well (which are the `actions` in the gym env language).\n",
    "There will be output files for comparisions to ensure TRACK is running properly.\n",
    "The `test_track.py` file runs TRACK and interactions with input / output files some.s\n",
    "The `data_generator.py` file is a rough start to interacting with TRACK via the gym-env framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Required Installs\n",
    "\n",
    "All codes (except TRACK) are in python. Hence, various standard python packages / libraries are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I added the `gym_optsb` locally via ``pip3 install -e gym-optsb`` inside the `optsb/code/gym_envs` directory\n",
    "\n",
    "To run TRACK, a working version of `wine` or `wine64` is needed. I (CRH) have a basic install of `wine` on my MAC via `homebrew`\n",
    "I have also tested wine64 on an Ubuntu install\n",
    "TRACK exe and all .dll files will be pulled via git.\n",
    "\n",

    "# GITHUB Clone\n",
    "\n",
    "I tested the git clone and exe on my MAC, still need to test on a linux distro.\n",

    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python test_track.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "The code will setup a new directory `/code/track/sps_line/testing/` and cp all TRACK files that are needed for input.\n",
    "It will then run one instance of TRACK setting all magnets to =0.\n",
